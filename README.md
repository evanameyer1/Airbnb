# AirBNB-Project

Introduction: My team and I were selected to provide a data driven recommendation to a potential first time Airbnb Host. 

Background: Using available data and supporting information, we developed recommendations based on the goals and constraints of our selected Investor persona. We hypothesized that, in the Fort Lauderdale area, a lower nightly property price and a shorter minimum nights requirement will increase estimated occupancy rates, subsequently increasing property revenue and value. 

Technical details: We used Excel as our main data driver, allowing us to analyze and manipulate data directly from the Airbnb website, as well as Power BI for visualizations, OneDrive for collaboration, Trello for project management, Powerpoint for presentations, and Word for project outlining and planning. 

Implementation: We first analyzed the data directly from the Airbnb website to understand the market and the direction we would take. While one team member looked at the Airbnb data, we had the others pull data from external sources, concerning finances, legislation, tourism, walk scores, taxes, and more. This ensures we consider possible confounding variables when making our recommendation. 

Results: We found that entire homes and apartments makeup 89.33% of the market, and of that, entire homes outperform entire rental units in occupancy rate and estimated income, generating almost 4x as much as rental units. As you move toward higher occupancy rates, listings trend toward lower nightly prices, and higher estimated income. Then, as you trend toward higher occupancy rate listings, we see a slight increase, peak, and then an ultimate decrease until you reach the highest occupancy rate listings, with the lowest amenity averages. This, combined with the pricing model findings, implies the highest occupancy rate models take the approach of appealing to cheaper customers who are looking for a quick and a cheap place that has the minimum amenities and needs. 

Conclusion: Ultimately, we recommended that our clients pursue a single-family home in the most walkable areas of Ft. Lauderdale. They should be looking for a home with a low amount of basic amenities, substituted with a select few “luxury” amenities (pool, close to beach, free parking, private patio). They should rent out the home during the busiest tourist seasons (January through July), and use the home themselves in a down season (August to November).
